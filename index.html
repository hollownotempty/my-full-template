            <h1>HOLLOW'S NEW SONG <em>CATERPILLAR</em> OUT NOW...</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Don't wanna stand too close to me
            sure you hate me too to some degree
            Thats fine just know I won't apologise
            apologise, apologise

            You can't force a caterpillar to change
            so why try to force this on me
            never gonna be on the same page
            never gonna see me grow wings

            Its not your game just face it
            like me with the thoughts, misplacing
            tryna catch up you chasing
            done with this shit stop talking to me

            You wouldn't know me in my new disguise
            I put on so I can sympathise
            with petty people pushing
            petting problems on to me
            don't they see that i don't care

            ok so

            You can't force a caterpillar to change
            so why try to force this on me
            never gonna be on the same page
            never gonna see me grow wings

            Its not your game just face it
            like me with the thoughts, misplacing
            tryna catch up you chasing
            done with this shit stop talking to me

            They're playing games I don't wanna play
            not really sure if I'm meant to stay
            when they don't like the way I am
            and I don't wanna be like them
